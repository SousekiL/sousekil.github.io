## How to Add Photos

Simply place your image files in this folder (`images/photography/`), and they will automatically appear on your Photography page.

### Supported Formats
- JPG / JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP

### Tips
1. **File Naming**: Use descriptive names for your photos. Underscores and hyphens will be converted to spaces for captions.
   - Example: `sunset_at_beach.jpg` → Caption: "Sunset at beach"
   - Example: `mountain-landscape.jpg` → Caption: "Mountain landscape"

2. **Image Size**: For best performance, resize images before uploading:
   - Recommended width: 1200-2000px
   - Compress images to reduce file size

3. **Organization**: You can also create subfolders here if you want to organize photos by theme or date.
