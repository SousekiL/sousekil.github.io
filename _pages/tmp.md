Hi, I'm Felix Liu.

I am a **data scientist** and an **aspiring actuary** focused on causal inference, risk modeling, and decision-oriented analytics. I have several years of industry experience at leading technology companies in China, including Kuaishou and TikTok.

I hold a master's degree in **Actuarial Science and Risk Management** from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before UIUC, I earned a bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University and a master's degree from Nanjing University.

I am currently pursuing SOA credentialing and have passed **SOA Exams P, FM, and SRM**, with additional exams in progress.

## Professional Focus

- Building statistically rigorous models for real-world business and policy questions
- Translating complex analysis into clear recommendations for non-technical stakeholders
- Applying causal, time-series, and risk frameworks to finance, climate, and social data
