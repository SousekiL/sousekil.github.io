Hello, I’m Felix.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in **Actuarial Science and Risk Management** at the Department of Mathematics of UIUC. Before graduate school, I worked as a data analyst and data scientist at major tech companies in China, including Kuaishou and TikTok. These roles provided me with extensive experience in data analysis and business analytics.

This website is a personal space where I share data analysis projects, learning reflections, and technical explorations. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss anything I post here!
