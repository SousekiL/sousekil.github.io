Hi, I'm Felix Liu.

I am a graduate student in the **Actuarial Science and Risk Management** master's program at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign** (UIUC). Prior to UIUC, I earned a bachelor's degree from **Xi'an Jiaotong University** and a master's degree from **Nanjing University**. My professional experience includes several years as a data scientist at top tech companies such as **Kuaishou** and **TikTok** in China. 

Concurrently, I am pursuing my actuarial certification. I have passed SOA Exams P, FM, and SRM, and am preparing for the CAS MAS-I and MAS-II exams.

This website is a personal space where I share data analysis projects, learning reflections, and technical explorations. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss anything I post here.
